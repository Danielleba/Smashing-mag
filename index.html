            <p>Computers and human beings don’t speak the same language. So, to make interaction possible,
                we rely on graphical user interfaces (GUIs). But GUIs come with a natural barrier: People
                 have to learn to use them. They have to learn that a hamburger button hides a menu, that a
                 button triggers an action. But with technology evolving and language recognition and processing
                  improving, we are on a path that could make interaction with digital services more intuitive,
                  more accessible and more efficient — through conversational interfaces.</p>

            <p>Virtual assistants that live inside messaging apps could help us arrange a trip, shop online,
                 order a ride or even do banking — all powered by chat. Already today, the number of applications
                  that rely on friendly conversation to nurture relationships with customers is growing.
                  In this article, we will look at the current state of conversational interfaces, the challenges
                   they bring and where things are heading.</p>

            <h3>Conversational Interfaces In The Wild</h3>
            <p>Conversational interfaces are still a rather rare sight. But slowly, more and more applications
                 are leaving behind the trusty GUI in favor of personal chat. Some of the conversations are already
                  driven by artificial intelligence (AI) — think of the infamous Slackbot — whereas others have humans
                   facilitating the conversation behind the scenes.</p>

            <h3>KLM</h3>
            <p>Take KLM. A new service by the Dutch airline uses a Facebook Messenger plugin to provide customers
                 with flight documentation via Messenger. Customers receive text messages reminding them of their
                  check-in time, as well as providing their boarding pass and their flight’s status — all in a
                  friendly and familiar tone, as if it were coming from a friend. And if the customer has any
                   questions or requests — for example, to change seats — they can reach out to KLM via Messenger,
                    too.</p>
            <aside>KLM sends flight documentation via Facebook Messenger.</aside>
            <p>The magic is based on a simple Facebook Messenger plugin that is seamlessly built into the booking
                 flow and that triggers the connection to Messenger. When someone books a ticket or checks in via
                  KLM.com, Facebook displays the plugin if the person has logged into Facebook or Messenger on that
                   device in the past 90 days. It’s enabled by default but can be unchecked if the user doesn’t wish
                    to receive any information or updates on their flight. An interesting approach.If you want to
                     tinker with the Messenger platform yourself, check out Facebook’s guide on how to use its tools
                      to build your own bot.</p>

            <h3>PANA</h3>
            <p>Virtual travel agent Pana uses a conversational UI with real humans behind the curtain.
                Communication is handled entirely over chat. To get started, a user is connected to one of
                Pana’s employees, who gets to know their travel preferences. Whenever the user needs to book
                a flight, find a hotel or hire a car, they send a message to Pana, and an assistant takes
                care of it. Pana will provide options and will book in coordination with the user.</p>
                <aside>Pana in action: The screen on the left shows all planned travels, and on the right,
                        a hotel recommendation in the chat. (Image: Pana)</aside>
                <p>The assistant also takes care of checking in, provides all necessary documentation, informs
                     about delays and arranges booking changes in case a flight gets canceled. The promise is that
                     when a user reaches out to Pana, someone from the team will answer the request in 60 seconds.
                     This is an interesting blend of personal service and the latest technology, coming in at $19
                     a month or $199 a year.</p>

            <h3>OPERATOR</h3>
            <p>Chris Messina, developer experience lead at Uber, claimed that 2016 would be the year of
                conversational commerce. One of the services that seek to change the way we shop online is
                 built completely on a conversational interface: Operator. Using it is as simple as writing
                 a text message. Install the Operator app (essentially, a messaging app), send a text saying
                 what you’re looking for (flowers for your spouse, a new messenger bag, concert tickets, anything),
                  and Operator will connect you to one of its experts, who will recommend something suitable for you.
                   If you like their suggestion, you can purchase and pay without having to leave the chat. Backed
                    by a network of merchants from around the world, Operator aims to deliver everything from everyday
                     essentials to exotic goods. The service is free and available 24/7 (in the US only, though).</p>

            <p>At the end of the day, I think keywords will win out at the end, when it comes to conversational
                interfaces.I would personally prefer engaging with a UI interface customized to get me to a point
                 of success with the least amount of taps, and preferably no keystrokes. But, if that’s not
                 possible, using keywords tied to my earlier behavior would be ideal.Beyond conversation though,
                 I think the Intelligent Web is the greatest frontier in Web design. Thanks for this article as it
                 raises a number of important issues and showcases services that give one a headstart.</p>
